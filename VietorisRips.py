def vietoris_rips(D, epsilon, k_max):
  #This function takes a distance matrix = D, epsilon, and the maximum degree k_max and computes the Vietoris-Rips filtration for each degree 0,1,2,...,k_max 


def boundary_maxrix(simplices_k, simplices_k_minus_1):
  #This function constructs the real-valued (numoy) boundary matrix from (k)-simplices to (k-1)-simplices.
